<p>Enter your key</p>

<p>Your key is a master password used to make your generated passwords unique to YOU. You can use the password "1234" for facebook.com and facebook will see a totally different 
Password to that. In simple terms you can imagine it as a prefix to your password. If you set your key to "ABCD" and type in "1234" but facebook your password will really be "ABCD1234facebook.com"*.
 </p>
 
<p>You will need your Key if you use Surpass on a different browser or ever clear the settings for this extension. If you use two computers to access the internet,
e.g. home and work, you should install Surpass on them both with the same key.</p>
